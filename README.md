ThemeCheck API
==============

### To Do
- Accept an uploaded theme folder (`.zip` only)
- Run through performance
- Child Themes trigger various errors when they shouldn't, needs more thought
- ~~Accept options for which checks are run~~
- ~~Get line number of error for the returned error message/object~~
- ~~Port over the rest of the checks~~
