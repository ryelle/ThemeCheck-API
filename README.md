ThemeCheck API
==============

### To Do
- ~~Accept an uploaded theme folder (`.zip` only)~~
- ~~Accept options for which checks are run~~
- ~~Get line number of error for the returned error message/object~~
- Port over the rest of the checks (30/40 done)
- Child Themes trigger various errors when they shouldn't, needs more thought
